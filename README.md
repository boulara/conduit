## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Node 20+
- PostgreSQL running locally

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/aaim uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The server auto-creates tables and seeds demo data on first start.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev   # runs at http://localhost:5173, proxies /api → :8000
```

## Deploy to Railway

1. Create a new project at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect this GitHub repo
3. Add a **PostgreSQL** plugin — Railway injects `DATABASE_URL` automatically
4. Set `RESEND_API_KEY` and `SALES_EMAIL` environment variables
5. Deploy — the Dockerfile handles the build, tables are created and seeded on first boot
