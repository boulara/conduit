# AAIM Portal

A secure team collaboration platform for managing patient case workflows and interdepartmental notifications, built by **FireFly Software LLC**.

Teams — **Home Office**, **NCM**, **SP**, and **Sales** — can view a shared patient dashboard, send notifications to each other, reply, acknowledge, add private case notes, and set follow-up reminders.

## Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI + PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy)
- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **Deployment:** Railway (single Docker service)
- **Email:** Resend API (Sales team notifications)

## Onboarding a New Organization

### Step 1 — Deploy
Follow the [Deploy to Railway](#deploy-to-railway) steps below. The system starts with demo data pre-loaded.

### Step 2 — Clear demo data (optional)
Log in as an admin (`sarah.johnson` / `pass123`), go to **Settings → Patients** and delete the demo cases, and **Settings → Users** to remove demo accounts.

### Step 3 — Import your users
1. Go to **Settings → Import**
2. Under **Import Users**, click **Download Template** to get `aaim_users_template.csv`
3. Fill in your team's login accounts:

| Column | Description | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `username` | Login username (lowercase) | e.g. `john.doe` |
| `password` | Initial password | any string |
| `name` | Display name | e.g. `John Doe` |
| `team` | Team assignment | `Home Office`, `NCM`, `SP`, `Sales` |
| `role` | Permission level | `admin`, `partner` |

4. Upload the filled CSV — duplicate usernames are skipped automatically.

### Step 4 — Import your case data
1. Under **Import Cases**, click **Download Template** to get `aaim_cases_template.csv`
2. Fill in your patient/case records:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `prescriber` | **Required.** Patient or prescriber identifier |
| `referral_date` | YYYY-MM-DD |
| `latest_sp_partner` | Specialty pharmacy partner name |
| `latest_sp_status` | SP status string |
| `latest_sp_substatus` | SP substatus string |
| `aging_of_status` | Integer — days since last status change |
| `latest_hub_sub_status` | HUB substatus |
| `primary_channel` | Commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, etc. |
| `primary_payer` | Payer name |
| `primary_pbm` | PBM name |
| `secondary_channel` | Secondary insurance channel |
| `territory` | Territory code |
| `region` | Region name (used for filtering) |
| `language` | Patient language |
| `hippa_consent` | `Yes`, `No`, or `Pending` |
| `program_type` | Program type label |
| `first_ship_date` | YYYY-MM-DD |
| `last_ship_date` | YYYY-MM-DD |
| `last_comment` | Free text comment |

3. Upload — each row becomes a case in the dashboard immediately.

### Step 5 — Share login credentials
Send each user their `username` and `password`. They log in at your Railway URL. Passwords can be updated at any time via **Settings → Users**.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Node 20+
- PostgreSQL running locally

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/aaim uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The server auto-creates tables and seeds demo data on first start.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev   # runs at http://localhost:5173, proxies /api → :8000
```

## Deploy to Railway

1. Create a new project at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect this GitHub repo
3. Add a **PostgreSQL** plugin — Railway injects `DATABASE_URL` automatically
4. Set `RESEND_API_KEY` and `SALES_EMAIL` environment variables
5. Deploy — the Dockerfile handles the build, tables are created and seeded on first boot
